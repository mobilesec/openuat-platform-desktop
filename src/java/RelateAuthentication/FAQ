1. Why LGPL and not X??
- it is very free, can also be used by non-open-source projects
- since it's about security protocols, they should be open to inspection --> new protocols/methods/tools within the toolkit must be open

2. why is Bouncycastle included?
- because some classes have been modified to work with J2ME
- but you can use the normal BC distribution instead of the included classes
